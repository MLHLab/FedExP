FedExP – a federated explainable framework for the identification of marker patterns in pneumonia-induced lung infections across diverse demographics

Pneumonia remains a critical global health issue, with high morbidity and mortality rates, particularly among children, the elderly, and immunocompromised populations. Although artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) models have improved diagnostic speed and accuracy, their adoption in clinical workflows is limited by concerns over data privacy and the opaque nature of these models. Federated Learning (FL) and explainable AI (XAI) have emerged as promising solutions to these challenges, but their combined application to identify pneumonia-specific marker patterns across diverse demographics remains underexplored. These marker patterns, varying by demographic factors, are crucial for early intervention strategies. In this work, we propose FedExP, an FL-XAI framework designed to analyze chest X-ray images from global datasets. FL ensures data privacy, while XAI offers insights into clinically relevant patterns. The dataset was curated from diverse regions to enhance the model’s generalizability. Two experimental setups were formed: (A) distinguishing viral from non-viral pneumonia and (B) differentiating Covid from non-covid cases. An attention-driven convolutional neural network (CNN) powered the framework in classifying pneumonia conditions, achieving superior accuracies of 0.9486±0.0254 (for setup A) and 0.9466±0.0184 (for setup B). Additionally, the proposed framework outperformed existing FL topologies. Further, we employed Grad-CAM (gradient-weighted class activation mapping) and LIME (local interpretable model-agnostic explanations) to identify key marker regions, with LIME offering more precise, clinically relevant explanations as validated and reported by a group of medical experts. Thus, FedExP has demonstrated an effective way of pneumonia diagnosis, while maintaining data privacy and model transparency.
